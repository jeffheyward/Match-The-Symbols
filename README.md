While making this project, I enjoyed the difficult part the most, which was modifying the original code. I say this beacuse it took about a few weeks thinking about what to add or what to change in the code in order to make it better than the original. I watched the same three YouTube videos almost daily to gain a sense of knowledge on what I will do to get started. I included functions that were not in the original code as a chance to challenge myself to go a little above and beyond in this project. Some of the code in this project were not taught in class, so websites such as pythonguides and programiz were great assets for me to learn new functions and codes that were included; furthermore, just understanding the purpose of the function and its contribution to the game. Continuously watching the same YouTube videos and taking notes of new codes via pythonguides and programiz were the ways I overcame my challenges in coding for this project. That may sound cliche, but it was the best way for me to learn and complete the game.
